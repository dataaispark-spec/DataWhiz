| Phi-3 | 3.8B | NLP tasks | Coding/reasoning with 128K context |
| IBM Granite 4.0 Tiny | 3B | Compliance | Hybrid efficiency, enterprise security |

### ⚖️ Competitive Analysis
- **vs. Snowflake**: Hours setup vs. weeks, $20-100/month vs. $200-500+ on 100GB
- **vs. Zoho Analytics**: LLM-first conversational AI, storage-first integration, disruptive pricing

## 🛠️ Setup

### Local Development

1. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt          # Full ML features
   # OR
   pip install -r requirements_basic.txt    # Basic functionality only
   ```

3. **Set environment variables (optional, for API models):**
   ```bash
   export XAI_API_KEY="your-xai-api-key-here"  # For Grok-4 API access (free tier available)
   # Local models work without API key, startup may take longer
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py  # Default configuration with API-based AI for fast startup
   ```

### 📊 Data Preparation

The app supports:
- **CSV Files**: Standard comma-separated values
- **Excel Files**: .xlsx or .xls formats
- **Google Drive**: Paste sharing URL for cloud data import

### 🤖 AI Features (Optional)

For full AI capabilities, install ML dependencies. The app provides graceful fallbacks:
- If ML libs unavailable, data upload and preview still work
- AI responses show helpful messages about installation
- Basic pandas processing ensures core functionality
