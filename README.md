## 🛠️ Setup

### Local Development

1. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt          # Full ML features
   # OR
   pip install -r requirements_basic.txt    # Basic functionality only
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py  # Updated from src/main.py for better packaging
   ```

### 📊 Data Preparation

The app supports:
